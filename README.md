The wireless IR headphone receiver utilizes the M300LD integrated circuit as a remote control transmitter. The circuits within the device receive electrical impulses and convert them into an audio signal. This audio signal is subsequently amplified using the LM386 amplifier and transmitted to the headphone, allowing for a wireless audio experience.
